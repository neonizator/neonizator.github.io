				<h4>About Me</h4>
				<p>I was born in Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine. I moved to the United States in because my father got a research position in the Chemistry Department at the University of Florida. My father has a PhD in Organic Chemistry. I went back to Ukraine only once in 2005 to visit my friends and family since the immigration. Unfortunately, due to the ongoing war in Ukraine I doubt if I will be able to visit the country again.</p>
				<p>I am an introvert and I tend to prefer working independently. However, when my friends ask for my help, I am always willing to help them to my best ability. Also, during group projects, I tend to take the lead because of my technical abilities and my tendency to complete projects meticulously. I also tend to make a persistent effort in solving problems. For example, if someone gives me a difficult problem with their computer, I would spend hours trying to solve it, even after they gave up hope.</p>

				<h4>Interests and Career</h4>
				<p>I have been always curious about and interested in electronics from a young age. My interests further extended to a computer when my family bought one. At a very young age when I could not even read and write, I used floppy disks to boot up and run software on the computer. Later, I taught myself how to use the Windows operating system and after taught my neighbors the basic use of a computer. During that time I also liked to disassemble toys and broken electronics to see how they worked.</p>
				<p>With the help of my friends I started working with MS Office and HTML. This allowed me to volunteer for a journal at UF to gain more experience. I formatted manuscripts and created PDF and HTML versions for publication on the website. Later, I got the position as network administrator for the same group. The new position involved fixing computers, troubleshooting software, managing users on the network, managing websites and databases, and helping with the organization of an annual conference. Working for the journal gave me a lot of experience in computer hardware, computer software, and working with other people.</p>
				<p>My goal is to become a computer scientist in the application development. I would like to have projects that can challenge my abilities and keep my work interesting. I want to live up to my own expectations to become successful in my field. I will only reach my life goal if I can live my life for myself and still provide for my family. My other goal is to set an example to other people. Due to my perfectionist qualities of my personality, I tend to push the people to perform better and more properly.</p>
