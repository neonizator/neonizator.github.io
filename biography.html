				<h4>Childhood</h4>
				<p>I was born in Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine. I moved to the United States in 2002 to Gainesville, FL because my father got a research position at the University of Florida, Chemistry Department. I have attended middle school and high school in Gainesville.</p>

				<h4>Interests and Career</h4>
				<p>I became interested in electronics from a young age. My interests further grew once my family acquired a computer. Before I could even read, I used floppy disks to boot up and run software on the computer. Later, I taught myself how to use the Windows operating system and shortly after I was teaching my neighbours the basic use of a computer. During that time I also liked to disassemble toys and broken electronics to see how they worked.</p>
				<p>With the help of my friends I started working with MS Office and HTML. This allowed me to volunteer for a journal at UF to gain more experience. Later, I got the position as network administrator for the same group. Working for the journal gave me a lot of experience in computer hardware and software, working with other people, and managing workload.</p>

				<h4>Vision</h4>
				<p>My goal is to work on projects that challenge my abilities and keep my work interesting. My aim is to work in application development. I want to live up to my own expectations to become successful in my field. I will only reach my life goal if I can live my life for myself and still be able to provide for my family. My other goal is to set an example to other people. Due to my perfectionist qualities of my personality, I tend to push the people close to me to perform better and to do things properly.</p>
